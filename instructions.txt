To clean data, we need to check each thing one at a time.


A 'for' loop checks each thing in a list. 

Example,

for n in myList

(n just means "the thing I am looking at now")


1) change n to another character. 


2) use code to remove the tiger from the list.



3) change the code so it can remove a pig from the list.

4) change the colored text to pig colors.


5) add 5 more animals to myList.

6) I use "debug", to show me what is going on. Now things are working, remove "debug".


7) run the unit test. does it pass?

8) submit the task.
